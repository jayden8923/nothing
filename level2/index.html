<h2>"level" 2</h2>

<p>hello!</p>
<p>you're here</p>
<p>nothing to see, or <strong>start</strong></p>
<p>also I didn't just give you a hint</p>

<p id="level3">Hmm. The link to the next level is meant to be here... Try using the hint my friend above gave you somewhere!</p>

<script>
  var start = 'You know, I did not have an idea for this. Would be nice if you responded with a normal phrase like ok.'
  var ok = "Well, guess you gotta move on to the next level. Look on the page." 
           document.getElementById("level3").innerHTML = "Hey! The next level like is here! https://jayden8923.github.io/nothing/level3";
